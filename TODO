- we should use thumb icons instead of arrows

- going back to the previous card doesn't seem to work

- voting on a tag should jump you to the next one?

- there should be a visual indicator for skipping to the next package

- packages & tags should be presented at random

- summaries aren't working

- Icons should be pulled from our xapian db

- the next card shouldn't be interactive... eg: you can vote on the next
  package without centering it. moving the voting links to the right side of the
  card should hopefully fix this issue

- the 'more details' should display a pop up in the app with more
  details, giving the user the ability to open fedoracommunity, etc
  in a new tab.
